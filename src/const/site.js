      "There are cards that get read once and then folded away, so we made you a different kind of card. You are reading it now. Every lamp on this page was lit by a student who remembers something you said.",
      "Forgive us for beginning with grammar, ma'am: you taught us that a sentence earns its meaning from where the pause falls. So we have placed our pauses carefully, and left room for the things we do not say aloud.",
      "You taught us Hindi the way it deserves to be taught — not as a subject to be passed, but as a country to be entered. कबीर became an argument worth having. रहीम became useful on an ordinary Tuesday. 'रस' stopped being a chapter and became the taste of a language.",
      "And somewhere between व्याकरण and जीवन, you also taught us how a school should feel. You noticed the quiet ones. You kept the door open. You were firm in the way that protects the people who need protecting.",
      "This Diwali, we hope some of that light comes home to you. May your house be loud with the people who make you laugh, your table never short of sweets, and your year ahead full of the good news you have quietly earned.",
      "May Maa Lakshmi bless your doorstep, Maa Saraswati bless your voice, and may the lamps you have lit in all of us never, ever go out.",
